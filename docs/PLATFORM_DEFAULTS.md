wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY --env development
# Paste: sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Verify
wrangler secret list --env development
```

**Where to get it:**
- https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### 2. Set Resend Key (Required)

## 🎯 User Override System (Email Only)

### Why Allow Override?

**Use Cases:**
1. **White-label customers** - Want emails from their brand
2. **Enterprise users** - Have their own email infrastructure
3. **Compliance** - Need emails from specific domains
4. **Volume users** - Already have SendGrid/Resend accounts

### How It Works

**Priority Order:**
```
1. Check: Does user have custom integration?
   ↓ YES
   Use their Resend/SendGrid account
   
   ↓ NO
   Use platform default (YOUR Resend)
```

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
// Check for custom integration
const userIntegration = await DB.prepare(`
  SELECT integration_type, api_key 
  FROM integrations 
  WHERE user_id = ? AND is_active = 1
`);

if (userIntegration) {
  // Use THEIR key and domain
  sendViaResend(email, subject, html, 
    userIntegration.api_key,           // Their key
    'hello@theirbrand.com',            // Their domain
    'Their Company'
  );
} else {
  // Use YOUR key and domain (DEFAULT)
  sendViaResend(email, subject, html,
    env.RESEND_API_KEY,                // Your key
    'task@customerconnects.com',       // Your domain
    'Task Manager'
  );
}
```

### User Setup (Optional)

**To use custom email:**
1. Click "Integrations" button
2. Go to "Resend" or "SendGrid" tab
3. Enter their API key
4. Select their verified domain
5. Save

**Their emails will now come from their domain!**
