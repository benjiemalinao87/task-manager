**Key Features:**
- Creates workspace if user doesn't have one

- Creates workspace invitations in database
- Queues professional invitation emails
- Tracks which users sent invites
- Handles existing members and duplicate invitations

#### Email Template: Onboarding Invitation

- **Run with:** `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply DB`

### 5. API Client Updates

## 📊 Viral Metrics to Track

### Key Metrics

1. **Invitation Sent Rate**
   - % of users who send invites during onboarding
   - Target: >60% for good viral growth

2. **Average Invites Per User**
   - Total invitations / Total users
   - Target: 3-5 invites per user

3. **Invitation Conversion Rate**
   - Invited users who sign up / Total invites
   - Target: >30% for viral growth

4. **Viral Coefficient (K)**
   - K = Avg Invites × Conversion Rate
   - K > 1 = Viral growth
   - K = 0.8-1.0 = Near viral (acceptable)
   - K < 0.8 = Sub-viral (needs optimization)

### SQL Queries

See [ONBOARDING_FLOW.md](./ONBOARDING_FLOW.md) for complete SQL queries to track:
- Invitation sent rates
- Average invitations per user
- Conversion rates
- Viral coefficient calculation
- Invitation chain tracking
