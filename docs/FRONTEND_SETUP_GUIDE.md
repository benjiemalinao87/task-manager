# Frontend Migration Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Been Done

The frontend has been migrated from Supabase to Cloudflare Workers API! Here's what's been implemented:

### 1. Authentication System
- ✅ `src/lib/api-client.ts` - API client with JWT auth handling
- ✅ `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - React auth context
- ✅ `src/components/auth/Login.tsx` - Login page
- ✅ `src/components/auth/Signup.tsx` - Signup page
- ✅ `src/components/auth/AuthPage.tsx` - Auth wrapper

### 2. Updated Components
- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Now uses AuthProvider and shows auth pages
- ✅ `src/components/TaskForm.tsx` - Uses API client
- ✅ `src/components/TaskList.tsx` - Uses API client (simplified!)
- ✅ `src/components/TaskHistory.tsx` - Uses API client

### 3. Configuration
- ✅ `.env.example` - Environment variables template

---

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Update Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update with your Cloudflare Workers URL:

```env
# For local development
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787

# For production (after deploying workers)
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 4: Start Backend (Cloudflare Workers)

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd cloudflare-workers
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8787`

## 🎯 Testing the Migration

### 1. Test Signup Flow

1. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser
2. You should see the Signup/Login page
3. Click "Sign up" and create an account:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Password: password123
4. You should be redirected to login

### 2. Test Login Flow

1. Login with the credentials you just created
2. You should be redirected to the Task Manager
3. You should see your name/email in the top right corner

### 3. Test Task Management

1. Create a new task:
   - Task Name: Test Migration
   - Description: Testing the Cloudflare migration
   - Estimated Time: 1 hour
2. The task should appear in the "Active Tasks" list
3. Click "Complete Task" to complete it
4. The task should move to the "Task History" tab

### 4. Test Logout

1. Click the logout button in the top right
2. You should be redirected to the login page
3. Your session should be cleared

## 🔍 What Changed from Supabase

### Before (Supabase)
```typescript
// Direct database access (insecure!)
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('tasks')
  .select('*');
// Returns ALL users' tasks ❌
```

### After (Cloudflare Workers)
```typescript
// API call with authentication
const tasks = await apiClient.getTasks('in_progress');
// Returns only YOUR tasks ✅
```

### Key Differences:

1. **Authentication Required**: Every API call now requires a JWT token
2. **Simplified Code**: Backend handles complex logic (emails, AI summaries, Asana)
3. **Better Security**: User data is isolated by user_id
4. **Cleaner Components**: No more Supabase-specific code

## 📁 File Changes Summary

### New Files
- `src/lib/api-client.ts` - API client wrapper
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Auth state management
- `src/components/auth/Login.tsx` - Login UI
- `src/components/auth/Signup.tsx` - Signup UI
- `src/components/auth/AuthPage.tsx` - Auth page wrapper
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### Modified Files
- `src/App.tsx` - Added AuthProvider and auth routing
- `src/components/TaskForm.tsx` - Uses apiClient instead of supabase
- `src/components/TaskList.tsx` - Simplified (backend handles emails/Asana)
- `src/components/TaskHistory.tsx` - Uses apiClient

### Files No Longer Needed (can be removed)
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client (replaced by api-client)
- ClockIn/ClockOut components - Can be updated later

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unauthorized" on all requests

**Solution:** Make sure the backend is running and JWT_SECRET is set

```bash
cd cloudflare-workers
wrangler secret list --env=development
npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Cannot connect to API"

**Solution:** Check that VITE_API_BASE_URL matches your backend URL

```bash
# In .env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787  # Must match wrangler dev port
```

### Issue: Login works but tasks don't load

**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Make sure:
1. Token is stored in localStorage
2. Backend has tasks table with data
3. API client is adding Authorization header

### Issue: AI summaries not appearing

**Solution:** 
1. Check that OPENAI_API_KEY is set in backend
2. AI summaries are generated asynchronously, wait a few seconds and refresh

## ✨ New Features

### 1. User Display
- Your name/email appears in the top right corner
- Shows which user is logged in

### 2. Logout Button
- Easy logout with session clearing
- Confirmation prompt

### 3. Simplified Task Management
- Backend now handles:
  - Email notifications (async via queue)
  - AI summaries (async)
  - Asana integration (if configured)
- Frontend just needs to call `createTask()`!
