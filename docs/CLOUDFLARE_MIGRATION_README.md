## Quick Start

### 1. Read the Master Plan

```bash
cat MIGRATION_PLAN.md
```

**Key Sections:**
- Current Architecture (understand what you have)
- Target Architecture (understand where you're going)
- Security Issues (why migration is critical)
- Timeline (2-3 weeks estimate)

### 2. Follow Documentation in Order

```
Week 1: Foundation
├── Day 1-2:  DATABASE_MIGRATION.md
│             • Create D1 database
│             • Convert schema
│             • Migrate data
│
└── Day 3-5:  AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md
              • Implement JWT auth
              • Create signup/login
              • Set up sessions

Week 2: Backend
├── Day 6-8:  WORKERS_MIGRATION.md (Part 1)
│             • Migrate 5 core workers
│             • Add auth middleware
│
└── Day 9-10: WORKERS_MIGRATION.md (Part 2)
              • Migrate remaining workers
              • Set up email queue

│
└── Day 14-15: DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
               • Deploy to production
               • Configure monitoring
               • Go live!
```

## Key Architecture Changes

### Current (Supabase) - INSECURE ❌

```
Browser → Supabase Client → PostgreSQL
  ↓
  No auth
  No user isolation
  All data public
```

### Target (Cloudflare) - SECURE ✅

```
Browser → Cloudflare Pages
  ↓ (JWT Token)
  ↓
Workers (Auth Check) → D1 Database
  ↓                      ↓
  ↓                   (user_id filter)
  ↓
KV (Sessions) + Queue (Emails)
```

---

## Critical Security Fixes

| Issue | Current | After Migration |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | None ❌ | JWT + KV sessions ✅ |
| **User Isolation** | None ❌ | user_id on all tables ✅ |
| **RLS Policies** | Allow all ❌ | Auth middleware ✅ |
| **API Keys** | Plaintext ❌ | Encrypted secrets ✅ |
| **Data Leakage** | All users see all data ❌ | Per-user filtering ✅ |

---

## Visual Diagrams Included

Each document includes ASCII diagrams for:

✅ **Data Flow**
- Request/response cycles
- Authentication flow
- Email queue processing

✅ **Architecture**
- System components
- Worker routing
- Database relationships

✅ **Before/After**
- Current vs target states
- Migration impact
- Security improvements

---

## Prerequisites

### Tools Required

```bash
# Install Wrangler CLI
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Accounts Needed

- [ ] Cloudflare account (free tier OK for testing)
- [ ] OpenAI API key (for AI summaries)
- [ ] SendGrid or Resend API key (for emails)
- [ ] Domain name (or use *.workers.dev / *.pages.dev)

---

## Estimated Costs

### Development (Free Tier)

```
Cloudflare Free Tier:
├── D1: 5 GB, 5M reads/day ✅
├── Workers: 100K requests/day ✅
├── KV: 100K reads/day ✅
├── Queues: 1M operations/month ✅
└── Pages: Unlimited ✅

External APIs (Paid):
├── OpenAI: ~$0.002 per task (GPT-3.5)
├── SendGrid: Free 100 emails/day
└── Total: <$10/month
```

### Production (Paid Tier)

```
Cloudflare Workers Paid ($5/month):
├── D1: 10 GB, 50M reads/day
├── Workers: 10M requests/month
├── KV: Unlimited
└── Queues: Unlimited

Estimated total: $10-20/month
(50-60% cheaper than Supabase Pro)
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Skip Authentication

**Why:** Without auth, you'll have the same security issues as before.

**Fix:** Complete `AUTHENTICATION_SETUP.md` before moving data to production.

### ❌ Don't Forget user_id Columns

**Why:** You won't be able to filter data by user.

**Fix:** Add `user_id` to ALL tables and foreign keys.

### ❌ Don't Deploy Without Testing

**Why:** You might break existing functionality.

**Fix:** Test locally with `wrangler dev` before deploying.

### ❌ Don't Store Secrets in Code

**Why:** Secrets will be exposed in Git.

**Fix:** Use `wrangler secret put` for API keys.

### ❌ Don't Migrate Without Backups

**Why:** Data loss if migration fails.

**Fix:** Export Supabase data before starting.

## Getting Help

### Issues During Migration?

1. **Check the specific guide** for your current step
2. **Review troubleshooting section** in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
3. **Test queries in D1** with `wrangler d1 execute`
4. **Check Worker logs** with `wrangler tail`
5. **Verify secrets are set** with `wrangler secret list`

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I run Supabase and Cloudflare in parallel?**
A: Yes! Keep Supabase running while you build on Cloudflare, then switch DNS when ready.

**Q: What if I need to rollback?**
A: See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md → Rollback Procedure. Keep Supabase backup.

**Q: Can I migrate incrementally?**
A: Yes, migrate one feature at a time (e.g., auth first, then tasks).

**Q: How do I test without breaking production?**
A: Use development environment (`wrangler dev`) and staging deployments.
