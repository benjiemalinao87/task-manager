## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

Monitor these metrics in the coming days:

1. **Invitation Sent Rate**
   - % of users sending invites during onboarding
   - Target: >60%

2. **Average Invites Per User**
   - Total invitations / Total users
   - Target: 3-5 invites/user

3. **Invitation Conversion Rate**
   - Signups from invites / Total invites
   - Target: >30%

4. **Viral Coefficient (K)**
   - K = Avg Invites × Conversion Rate
   - Goal: K > 1.0 for viral growth

### SQL Queries

Use the queries in [ONBOARDING_FLOW.md](./ONBOARDING_FLOW.md) to track:
- Invitation rates
- Conversion rates
- Viral coefficient
- Invitation chains
