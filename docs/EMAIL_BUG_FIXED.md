# 🐛 Email Bug Fixed! 

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Issue:** Task creation emails were not being sent  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## What Was Wrong?

The signup process was **not setting `default_email`** in the user's settings, which caused the email notification system to skip sending emails.

## What Was Fixed?

### 1. ✅ Signup Process
- Updated `auth.ts` to set `default_email` = user's email during registration
- New users will automatically have their email configured

### 2. ✅ Existing Users
- Ran database migration to update existing users
- Your account now has `default_email` set to: `benjiemalinao87@gmail.com`

### 3. ✅ Resend API Key
- Updated RESEND_API_KEY with your key: `re_g458KPjb_HiiD6uQLTcm86Am3y7FSv6XM`
- Sender email: `task@customerconnects.com`

### 4. ✅ Verification
Checked your settings in database:
```
✅ Email: benjiemalinao87@gmail.com
✅ Default Email: benjiemalinao87@gmail.com

  --command "SELECT users.email, settings.default_email, settings.notify_task_created FROM users JOIN settings ON users.id = settings.user_id;"
