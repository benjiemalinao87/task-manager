# User Onboarding Flow - Viral Loop with Invitations

## Overview

After a user signs up, they are guided through a beautiful 2-step onboarding flow:
1. **Notification Preferences** - Choose which email notifications to receive
2. **Invite Colleagues** (NEW) - Invite team members to create a viral growth loop

This creates a great first impression, lets users customize their experience, and drives organic user growth through team invitations.

## ðŸ“± Frontend Implementation

### Components

**NotificationPreferences.tsx**
- Located: `src/components/onboarding/NotificationPreferences.tsx`
- Props: `{ onComplete: () => void }`
- State: Manages selected notification preferences
- Actions: Save preferences or skip

**AuthContext Updates**
- Added `needsOnboarding: boolean` state
- Added `checkOnboardingStatus()` function
- Added `completeOnboarding()` function
- Checks onboarding status on login

**App.tsx Flow**
```typescript
function AppContent() {
  const { isAuthenticated, needsOnboarding, completeOnboarding } = useAuth();

  // 1. Loading state
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;

  // 2. Not authenticated â†’ Login/Signup
  if (!isAuthenticated) return <AuthPage />;

  // 3. Needs onboarding â†’ Notification Preferences
  if (needsOnboarding) return <NotificationPreferences onComplete={completeOnboarding} />;

  // 4. All set â†’ Main App
  return <TaskManager />;
}
```

### State Management

**Initial State (After Signup):**
```javascript
{
  isAuthenticated: true,
  needsOnboarding: true,  // Because onboarding_completed = 0
  user: { id: "...", email: "...", name: "..." }
}
```

**After Onboarding:**
```javascript
{
  isAuthenticated: true,
  needsOnboarding: false,  // Because onboarding_completed = 1
  user: { id: "...", email: "...", name: "..." }
}
```

## ðŸ”„ Email Logic

### How Notifications Are Sent

When a task is created or completed, the email worker checks user preferences:

```typescript
// In email-consumer.ts
const settings = await DB.prepare(
  'SELECT * FROM settings WHERE user_id = ?'
).bind(userId).first();

// For task created
if (type === 'task_created' && !settings.notify_task_created) {
  return; // Don't send email
}

// For task completed
if (type === 'task_completed' && !settings.notify_task_completed) {
  return; // Don't send email
}

// Send email if preference is enabled
sendEmail(email, subject, body);
```

### Default Behavior
- New users: Task created & completed emails enabled by default
- If user skips onboarding: All notifications disabled
- Can change anytime in Settings

## ðŸ”„ Viral Loop Feature (NEW)

### How It Works

**Step 1: User Invites Colleagues**
- During onboarding (Step 2), users can invite up to 5 colleagues
- System automatically creates or uses user's workspace
- Professional invitation emails sent with inviter's name
- Invitations stored in database with 7-day expiration

**Step 2: Invitation Email**
The invited colleague receives a beautiful, professional email featuring:
- Inviter's name and email
- Workspace name they'll join
- Benefits of using Workoto
- One-click signup link
- "Early Adopter Plan" badge

**Step 3: Auto-Workspace Join**
When an invited user signs up:
- System checks for pending invitations matching their email
- Automatically accepts all valid invitations
- User joins the inviter's workspace immediately
- No manual invitation acceptance needed
- User can see both their own workspace and shared workspaces

**Step 4: Cycle Repeats**
- The invited user goes through the same onboarding
- They can invite their own colleagues
- Creates exponential growth potential
- Each cohort brings in the next cohort

### Viral Coefficient Calculation

```
Viral Coefficient (K) = Invitations Sent Ã— Conversion Rate

Example:
- If each user invites 3 colleagues on average (60% send 5 invites)
- And 30% of invited users sign up
- K = 3 Ã— 0.30 = 0.9

To achieve K > 1 (viral growth):
- Target: 4 invites Ã— 30% conversion = 1.2 (20% organic growth per cycle)
- Or: 3 invites Ã— 35% conversion = 1.05 (5% organic growth per cycle)
```

### Database Schema

**New Field in Settings:**
```sql
onboarding_invites_sent INTEGER DEFAULT 0  -- Track if user sent invites
```

**Workspace Invitations Table:**
Used to track invitations and auto-join on signup.

### SQL Queries

**Onboarding completion rate:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  SUM(CASE WHEN onboarding_completed = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN onboarding_completed = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as completion_rate
FROM users
JOIN settings ON users.id = settings.user_id
WHERE users.created_at >= datetime('now', '-30 days');
```

**Most popular notification combinations:**
```sql
SELECT
  notify_task_created,
  notify_task_completed,
  notify_daily_summary,
  notify_weekly_summary,
  COUNT(*) as user_count
FROM settings
WHERE onboarding_completed = 1
GROUP BY notify_task_created, notify_task_completed, notify_daily_summary, notify_weekly_summary
ORDER BY user_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Viral Loop Metrics (NEW):**

**Invitation sent rate:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_users,
  SUM(CASE WHEN onboarding_invites_sent = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as users_who_invited,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN onboarding_invites_sent = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as invitation_rate_percent
FROM settings
WHERE onboarding_completed = 1;
```

**Average invitations per user:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT invited_by) as users_who_invited,
  COUNT(*) as total_invitations,
  ROUND(CAST(COUNT(*) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT invited_by), 2) as avg_invites_per_user
FROM workspace_invitations
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-30 days');
```

**Invitation conversion rate:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_invitations,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as accepted,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as conversion_rate_percent
FROM workspace_invitations
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-30 days');
```

**Viral coefficient (K):**
```sql
WITH invite_stats AS (
  SELECT
    ROUND(CAST(COUNT(*) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT invited_by), 2) as avg_invites_per_user,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 4) as conversion_rate
  FROM workspace_invitations
  WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-30 days')
)
SELECT
  avg_invites_per_user,
  conversion_rate,
  ROUND(avg_invites_per_user * conversion_rate, 3) as viral_coefficient_k,

    ELSE 'ðŸ“Š Sub-Viral'
  END as growth_status
FROM invite_stats;
```

**Invitation chain tracking:**
```sql
-- Track who invited whom (generation 1 and 2)
WITH invited_users AS (
  SELECT
    wi.invited_by as inviter_id,
    u_inviter.email as inviter_email,
    wi.email as invited_email,
    u_invited.id as invited_user_id,
    wi.status,
    wi.created_at
  FROM workspace_invitations wi
  LEFT JOIN users u_inviter ON wi.invited_by = u_inviter.id
  LEFT JOIN users u_invited ON wi.email = u_invited.email
  WHERE wi.created_at >= datetime('now', '-30 days')
)
SELECT
  inviter_email,
  COUNT(*) as people_invited,
  SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'accepted' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as signups,
