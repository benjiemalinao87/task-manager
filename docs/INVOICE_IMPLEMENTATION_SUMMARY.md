## What Needs to Be Done (Backend)

The frontend is **100% complete**. You now need to implement the backend API:

### Required Implementation

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Run the migration script
   wrangler d1 execute YOUR_DATABASE --file=cloudflare-workers/migrations/add-invoice-tables.sql
   ```

2. **Implement API Endpoints**

   See `INVOICE_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for detailed specifications.

   **Priority endpoints:**
   - POST `/api/invoices` - Create invoice
   - GET `/api/invoices` - List invoices
   - GET `/api/invoices/:id` - Get invoice
   - GET `/api/invoices/tasks` - Get billable tasks
   - GET `/api/invoice-settings` - Get settings
   - PATCH `/api/invoice-settings` - Update settings

   **Secondary endpoints:**
   - POST `/api/invoices/:id/send` - Email invoice
   - POST `/api/invoices/:id/share` - Generate share link
   - GET `/api/invoices/share/:token` - Public view
   - PATCH `/api/invoices/:id` - Update invoice
   - DELETE `/api/invoices/:id` - Delete invoice

3. **Email Integration**
   - Use existing Resend/SendGrid integration
   - Implement email template from documentation
   - Include invoice link in email

4. **Invoice Number Generation**
   - Format: {prefix}-{year}-{number}
   - Example: INV-2025-001
   - Auto-increment from invoice_settings.next_invoice_number
