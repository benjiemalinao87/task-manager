# Fix for Assigned Tasks Timer Issue

## Problem
Tasks assigned to members were automatically starting timers, even though members might not be ready to work on them immediately.

## Root Cause
1. **Backend Logic**: Task creation was setting `started_at = now` for ALL tasks, regardless of assignment
2. **Database State**: Existing tasks created before the fix had wrong status values
3. **Frontend Cache**: Browser was showing cached data with old task statuses

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Backend Logic ✅
- Updated task creation to set `status = 'pending'` and `started_at = null` for assigned tasks
- Updated task assignment to set `status = 'pending'` when assigning to members
- Updated recurring tasks to respect assignment status

### 2. Fixed Database State ✅
Updated existing tasks in database:
```sql
UPDATE tasks SET status = 'pending' 
WHERE assigned_to IS NOT NULL AND status = 'in_progress'
```
- Fixed 5 tasks that were created with old logic
- All assigned tasks now have `status = 'pending'`

### 3. Frontend Cache Issue ⚠️
The frontend may still show cached data. **User needs to refresh the page** to see updated task statuses.

## Verification
After refreshing the page:
- ✅ Assigned tasks should show as "Pending" (no timer running)
- ✅ Only unassigned tasks should have timers running
- ✅ Members can manually start timers when ready to work

## Files Updated
- `cloudflare-workers/src/workers/tasks.ts` - Task creation/assignment logic
- `cloudflare-workers/src/workers/tasks-updated.ts` - Same fixes
- `cloudflare-workers/src/workers/recurring-tasks.ts` - Recurring task logic
- `src/components/TaskList.tsx` - Frontend timer registration
- Database: Updated 5 existing tasks to correct status

## Next Steps
1. **Refresh the browser page** to see updated task statuses
2. **Test creating new tasks** - assigned tasks should not auto-start timer
3. **Test task assignment** - assigning should stop timer, unassigning should start timer
