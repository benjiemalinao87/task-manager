# Lessons Learned - Task Manager Migration

## Bug Fix: Email Notifications Not Sending (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem
Users were creating tasks but not receiving email notifications, even though:
- RESEND_API_KEY was set
- Notification preferences were enabled
- Email queue consumer was working

### Root Cause
The signup function in `auth.ts` was not setting `default_email` when creating user settings.

**Buggy code:**
```typescript
await c.env.DB.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO settings (id, user_id, created_at, updated_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
`).bind(settingsId, userId, now, now).run();
```

This caused `settings.default_email` to be `NULL`, which made the tasks worker skip sending emails:

```typescript
// In tasks.ts
const settings = await c.env.DB.prepare(
  'SELECT default_email FROM settings WHERE user_id = ?'
).bind(auth.userId).first();

// This condition fails if default_email is NULL
if (settings && settings.default_email) {
  await c.env.EMAIL_QUEUE.send({...});
}
```

### Solution
**Fixed code:**
```typescript
await c.env.DB.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO settings (id, user_id, default_email, created_at, updated_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
`).bind(settingsId, userId, email.toLowerCase(), now, now).run();
```

**Migration for existing users:**
```sql
UPDATE settings 
SET default_email = (
  SELECT email FROM users WHERE users.id = settings.user_id
)
WHERE default_email IS NULL OR default_email = '';
```

### How to Avoid This
1. ‚úÖ **Always set required fields during record creation** - Even if they can be updated later, set sensible defaults immediately
2. ‚úÖ **Test the full user flow** - From signup ‚Üí create task ‚Üí receive email
3. ‚úÖ **Add database constraints** - Consider `NOT NULL` constraints on critical fields like `default_email`
4. ‚úÖ **Validate settings exist before using them** - Add defensive checks in business logic
5. ‚úÖ **Use migrations for existing data** - When fixing bugs, don't forget existing users

### Deployment Steps
1. Fixed `auth.ts` to include `default_email` in INSERT
2. Deployed to Cloudflare: `wrangler deploy --env development`
3. Updated RESEND_API_KEY: `wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY --env development`
4. Migrated existing users: `wrangler d1 execute --remote --command "UPDATE settings..."`

### Verification
```sql
SELECT users.email, settings.default_email, settings.notify_task_created 
FROM users 
JOIN settings ON users.id = settings.user_id;
```

Expected output:
```
email: benjiemalinao87@gmail.com
default_email: benjiemalinao87@gmail.com ‚úì
notify_task_created: 1 ‚úì
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new user account
- [ ] Verify settings are created with default_email
- [ ] Create a task
- [ ] Verify email is sent to default_email
- [ ] Check email queue logs for any errors
- [ ] Complete a task
- [ ] Verify completion email is sent

## Key Takeaway
**When implementing signup/registration:**
1. Create all related records (user, settings, etc.) in a single transaction if possible
2. Set ALL important fields immediately, don't rely on later updates
3. Test the entire user journey, not just the signup endpoint
4. Have a migration strategy for existing users when fixing bugs

## Bug Fix: Wrong Email Domain (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem
Emails were not being sent even though:
- RESEND_API_KEY was set correctly
- default_email was configured
- Email queue was working
- Notification preferences were enabled

### Root Cause
**Domain mismatch!** The code was trying to send from `task@customerconnects.com` but the verified domain in Resend was `customerconnects.app`.

**Buggy code:**
```typescript
const DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'task@customerconnects.com';  // Wrong!
```

**Resend verified domain:**
```json
{
  "name": "customerconnects.app",
  "status": "verified"
}
```

**Error:** Resend rejects emails from unverified domains, so all emails were silently failing.

### Solution
**Fixed code:**
```typescript
const DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'task@customerconnects.app';  // Correct!
```

### How to Avoid This
1. ‚úÖ **Always verify domain in Resend first** - Before coding, check what domains you have
2. ‚úÖ **Test email sending immediately** - Don't wait until user reports it
3. ‚úÖ **Check Resend API response** - Add error logging for failed sends
4. ‚úÖ **Document verified domains** - Keep a list of production-ready domains
5. ‚úÖ **Use Resend dashboard** - Check "Emails" tab to see if any were attempted

### Verification
```bash
# Check verified domains
curl -X GET "https://api.resend.com/domains" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY"

# Look for:
# "status": "verified"
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new task
- [ ] Check email inbox (within 30 seconds)
- [ ] Complete a task
- [ ] Check email inbox again
- [ ] Check Resend dashboard for sent emails
- [ ] Check Cloudflare logs for any errors

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed

## Bug Fix: AI Summary Not in Task Creation Emails (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem
Task creation emails were being sent immediately without the AI summary, even though AI summaries were being generated and shown on task cards in the UI.

**User Experience:**
- UI showed AI summary on task card ‚úÖ
- Task completion email showed AI summary ‚úÖ
- **Task creation email had NO AI summary** ‚ùå

### Root Cause
**Race condition!** The email was sent before the AI summary was generated.

**Buggy flow:**
```
1. Task created in database
2. AI summary generation triggered (async, "fire and forget")
3. Email sent immediately ‚Üê Email goes out without AI summary!
4. AI summary finishes later (but email already sent)
```

**Code showing the problem:**
```typescript
// In tasks.ts
const task = await DB.prepare('INSERT INTO tasks...').run();

// AI generation (async, doesn't wait)
c.executionCtx.waitUntil(
  fetch('/api/ai/generate-summary', {...})  // Fire and forget
);

// Email sent immediately (no AI summary yet!)
await EMAIL_QUEUE.send({
  type: 'task_created',
  task: {
    name: taskName,
    description,
    estimatedTime
    // ‚ùå No aiSummary!
  }
});
```

### Solution
**Move email sending to AFTER AI summary generation.**

**Fixed flow:**
```
1. Task created in database
2. AI summary generation triggered (async)
3. AI summary generated by OpenAI
4. AI summary saved to database
5. Email sent WITH AI summary ‚Üê Email now includes AI!
```

**Fixed code:**

**tasks.ts (removed immediate email):**
```typescript
const task = await DB.prepare('INSERT INTO tasks...').run();

// AI generation WITH email notification
c.executionCtx.waitUntil(
  fetch('/api/ai/generate-summary', {
    body: JSON.stringify({
      taskId,
      taskName,
      description,
      estimatedTime,
      sendEmail: true  // Tell AI worker to send email
    })
  })
);

// ‚úÖ No immediate email, it will be sent after AI is done
```

**ai.ts (added email after summary):**
```typescript
// Generate AI summary
const summary = await openai.chat.completions.create({...});

// Save summary to database
await DB.prepare('UPDATE tasks SET ai_summary = ?').bind(summary).run();

// Send email WITH AI summary
if (sendEmail) {
  await EMAIL_QUEUE.send({
    type: 'task_created',
    task: {
      name: taskName,
      description,
      estimatedTime,
      aiSummary: summary  // ‚úÖ AI summary included!
    }
  });
}
```

**email-consumer.ts (added AI summary to template):**
```typescript
// In buildTaskCreatedEmail()
<div class="task-name">${task.name}</div>

${task.aiSummary ? `
<div class="ai-summary-box">
  <strong>ü§ñ AI INSIGHT</strong>
  <p>${task.aiSummary}</p>
</div>
` : ''}
```

### How to Avoid This
1. ‚úÖ **Understand async operations** - "fire and forget" means you don't wait for results
2. ‚úÖ **Chain dependent operations** - If B depends on A, trigger B after A completes
3. ‚úÖ **Test the entire flow** - Create task ‚Üí Check email ‚Üí Verify AI summary is there
4. ‚úÖ **Add timing logs** - Log when each step happens to debug race conditions
5. ‚úÖ **Consider user experience** - Is it better to send email quickly without AI, or wait 2-3 seconds for AI?

### Trade-offs

**Option 1: Send email immediately (old way)**
- ‚úÖ Fast response
- ‚ùå No AI summary in email
- ‚ùå Incomplete information

**Option 2: Send email after AI (new way)**
- ‚úÖ Complete information with AI insight
- ‚úÖ Better user experience
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Email arrives 2-3 seconds later (acceptable)

**Decision:** Option 2 is better because AI insights are valuable and users expect them.

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new task
- [ ] Wait for AI summary to appear on task card (2-3 seconds)
- [ ] Check email inbox
- [ ] Verify email contains:
  - ‚úÖ Task name
  - ‚úÖ Description
  - ‚úÖ Estimated time
  - ‚úÖ **AI summary** with ü§ñ icon
  - ‚úÖ Beautiful blue box design
- [ ] Complete the task
- [ ] Verify completion email also has AI summary

### Performance Impact
**Before:** Email sent in ~100ms (but incomplete)  
**After:** Email sent in ~2-3 seconds (but complete with AI)  

**User doesn't notice because:**
- Email is async anyway (they check it later)
- 2-3 seconds is acceptable for email delivery
- The value of AI insights outweighs the delay

## Bug Fix: Asana Tasks Not Being Assigned (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem
Asana integration was creating tasks successfully and completing them, but tasks were **not being assigned** to the correct user in Asana.

**Symptoms:**
- ‚úÖ Tasks created in Asana
- ‚úÖ Tasks completed in Asana
- ‚ùå Tasks not assigned to anyone

### Root Cause
**Invalid email format in database!** The `default_assignee_email` in the `integrations` table config was missing the `@` symbol.

**Bad data in D1:**
```json
{
  "project_gid": "1206615013870411",
  "default_assignee_email": "benjiechannelautomation.com",  // ‚ùå Missing @
  "workspace_gid": "1204857085390737"
}
```

**Should be:**
```json
{
  "project_gid": "1206615013870411",
  "default_assignee_email": "benjie@channelautomation.com",  // ‚úÖ Valid email
  "workspace_gid": "1204857085390737"
}
```

**Why this breaks assignment:**

The code in `tasks.ts` (lines 82-123) correctly:
1. Fetches all users from Asana workspace
2. Looks for a user whose email matches `default_assignee_email` (case-insensitive)
3. If found, sets `asanaPayload.data.assignee = user.gid`

However, when searching with `benjiechannelautomation.com`, no match is found because:
- Asana user emails are properly formatted: `user@domain.com`
- The search looks for exact match: `u.email?.toLowerCase() === assigneeEmail.toLowerCase()`
- `user@domain.com` !== `userdomain.com`

### Solution

**Step 1: Find your correct email in Asana**

First, check what email is associated with your Asana account:
```bash
# Using wrangler to query Asana
wrangler secret put ASANA_TOKEN --env development
# Then manually check Asana settings or use this query
```

Or check manually at: https://app.asana.com/0/my-settings ‚Üí Profile

**Step 2: Update the D1 database**

```sql
-- Update the config JSON with correct email
UPDATE integrations
SET config = json_set(
  config,
  '$.default_assignee_email',
  'YOUR_CORRECT_EMAIL@domain.com'  -- Replace with your actual email
)
WHERE integration_type = 'asana'
AND user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

**Step 3: Run via wrangler**

```bash
wrangler d1 execute task-manager-dev --remote --command "
UPDATE integrations
SET config = json_set(config, '$.default_assignee_email', 'benjie@channelautomation.com')
WHERE integration_type = 'asana';
"
```

**Step 4: Verify the fix**

```sql
SELECT id, user_id, integration_type, config
FROM integrations
WHERE integration_type = 'asana';
```

### How to Avoid This

1. ‚úÖ **Add email validation in frontend** - When user enters Asana config, validate email format
2. ‚úÖ **Validate on backend** - Check email format before saving to database
3. ‚úÖ **Test assignee lookup** - When saving integration, immediately test if user can be found
4. ‚úÖ **Better error messages** - Log when assignee lookup fails with available emails
5. ‚úÖ **Auto-detect email** - Use Asana API to get current user's email automatically

### Code Improvements

**Add validation in integrations worker:**

```typescript
// In integrations.ts
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}

// Before saving config
if (config.default_assignee_email && !isValidEmail(config.default_assignee_email)) {
  return c.json({ error: 'Invalid email format for assignee' }, 400);
}
```

**Better logging in tasks.ts (already present but worth highlighting):**

```typescript
// Line 111-112 shows available emails when lookup fails
console.log(`‚úó User with email ${assigneeEmail} not found. Available emails:`,
  usersData.data?.filter((u: any) => u.email).map((u: any) => u.email).join(', '));
```

This helps debug email mismatches!

### Testing Checklist

After fixing the email:
- [ ] Create a new task in the app
- [ ] Check Asana project - task should appear
- [ ] Verify task is assigned to the correct user
- [ ] Check Cloudflare logs for "‚úì Assigned task to user: ..."
- [ ] Complete the task in app
- [ ] Verify task is marked complete in Asana

### Key Takeaway

**When implementing third-party integrations:**
1. **Validate all input data** - Email, URLs, IDs, etc.
2. **Test integration immediately** - Don't wait until user reports issue
3. **Add helpful logging** - Show what the system is looking for vs what it found
4. **Fail gracefully** - If assignee not found, still create task (already doing this!)
5. **Guide users** - Consider fetching user email from Asana automatically

**The code was correct, the data was wrong!** This highlights the importance of input validation.

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Changed to use `/users/me` API instead of email lookup  
**Date:** October 12, 2025

### Update: The Real Root Cause

After checking the actual database, the email was correctly stored with `@` symbol. The real issue was different:

**The Asana workspace users API doesn't expose email addresses!**

When querying `GET /workspaces/{gid}/users?opt_fields=email,name,gid`:
- ‚úÖ Returns 343 users
- ‚ùå Email field is empty for all users (privacy/permissions)
- Result: Cannot match users by email

**Better Solution Implemented:**

Instead of looking up users by email, use the authenticated user directly:

```typescript
// OLD APPROACH (doesn't work)
const usersResponse = await fetch(
  `https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces/${workspaceGid}/users?opt_fields=email,name,gid`
);
const user = usersData.data?.find(u => u.email === assigneeEmail); // Always fails!

// NEW APPROACH (works!)
const meResponse = await fetch('https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/users/me', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${api_key}` }
});
asanaPayload.data.assignee = userData.data.gid; // Always assigns to token owner
```

**Benefits:**
1. ‚úÖ No email lookup needed
2. ‚úÖ Always assigns to the API token owner (usually correct)
3. ‚úÖ More reliable - no privacy/permission issues
4. ‚úÖ Simpler code - one API call instead of searching through hundreds of users

**Files Changed:**
- `cloudflare-workers/src/workers/tasks.ts` - Lines 82-115

**Deployment:**
```bash
wrangler deploy --env development
# Version: 80530646-8fe4-48be-b9fe-d8dd185a9a81
```
