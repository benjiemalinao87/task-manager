# Lessons Learned - Task Manager Migration

## Bug Fix: Email Notifications Not Sending (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem
Users were creating tasks but not receiving email notifications, even though:
- RESEND_API_KEY was set
- Notification preferences were enabled
- Email queue consumer was working

### Root Cause
The signup function in `auth.ts` was not setting `default_email` when creating user settings.

**Buggy code:**
```typescript
await c.env.DB.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO settings (id, user_id, created_at, updated_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
`).bind(settingsId, userId, now, now).run();
```

This caused `settings.default_email` to be `NULL`, which made the tasks worker skip sending emails:

```typescript
// In tasks.ts
const settings = await c.env.DB.prepare(
  'SELECT default_email FROM settings WHERE user_id = ?'
).bind(auth.userId).first();

// This condition fails if default_email is NULL
if (settings && settings.default_email) {
  await c.env.EMAIL_QUEUE.send({...});
}
```

### Solution
**Fixed code:**
```typescript
await c.env.DB.prepare(`
  INSERT INTO settings (id, user_id, default_email, created_at, updated_at)
  VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
`).bind(settingsId, userId, email.toLowerCase(), now, now).run();
```

**Migration for existing users:**
```sql
UPDATE settings 
SET default_email = (
  SELECT email FROM users WHERE users.id = settings.user_id
)
WHERE default_email IS NULL OR default_email = '';
```

### How to Avoid This
1. ‚úÖ **Always set required fields during record creation** - Even if they can be updated later, set sensible defaults immediately
2. ‚úÖ **Test the full user flow** - From signup ‚Üí create task ‚Üí receive email
3. ‚úÖ **Add database constraints** - Consider `NOT NULL` constraints on critical fields like `default_email`
4. ‚úÖ **Validate settings exist before using them** - Add defensive checks in business logic
5. ‚úÖ **Use migrations for existing data** - When fixing bugs, don't forget existing users

### Deployment Steps
1. Fixed `auth.ts` to include `default_email` in INSERT
2. Deployed to Cloudflare: `wrangler deploy --env development`
3. Updated RESEND_API_KEY: `wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY --env development`
4. Migrated existing users: `wrangler d1 execute --remote --command "UPDATE settings..."`

### Verification
```sql
SELECT users.email, settings.default_email, settings.notify_task_created 
FROM users 
JOIN settings ON users.id = settings.user_id;
```

Expected output:
```
email: benjiemalinao87@gmail.com
default_email: benjiemalinao87@gmail.com ‚úì
notify_task_created: 1 ‚úì
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new user account
- [ ] Verify settings are created with default_email
- [ ] Create a task
- [ ] Verify email is sent to default_email
- [ ] Check email queue logs for any errors
- [ ] Complete a task
- [ ] Verify completion email is sent

---

## Key Takeaway
**When implementing signup/registration:**
1. Create all related records (user, settings, etc.) in a single transaction if possible
2. Set ALL important fields immediately, don't rely on later updates
3. Test the entire user journey, not just the signup endpoint
4. Have a migration strategy for existing users when fixing bugs

## Bug Fix: Wrong Email Domain (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem
Emails were not being sent even though:
- RESEND_API_KEY was set correctly
- default_email was configured
- Email queue was working
- Notification preferences were enabled

### Root Cause
**Domain mismatch!** The code was trying to send from `task@customerconnects.com` but the verified domain in Resend was `customerconnects.app`.

**Buggy code:**
```typescript
const DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'task@customerconnects.com';  // Wrong!
```

**Resend verified domain:**
```json
{
  "name": "customerconnects.app",
  "status": "verified"
}
```

**Error:** Resend rejects emails from unverified domains, so all emails were silently failing.

### Solution
**Fixed code:**
```typescript
const DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'task@customerconnects.app';  // Correct!
```

### How to Avoid This
1. ‚úÖ **Always verify domain in Resend first** - Before coding, check what domains you have
2. ‚úÖ **Test email sending immediately** - Don't wait until user reports it
3. ‚úÖ **Check Resend API response** - Add error logging for failed sends
4. ‚úÖ **Document verified domains** - Keep a list of production-ready domains
5. ‚úÖ **Use Resend dashboard** - Check "Emails" tab to see if any were attempted

### Verification
```bash
# Check verified domains
curl -X GET "https://api.resend.com/domains" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RESEND_API_KEY"

# Look for:
# "status": "verified"
```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new task
- [ ] Check email inbox (within 30 seconds)
- [ ] Complete a task
- [ ] Check email inbox again
- [ ] Check Resend dashboard for sent emails
- [ ] Check Cloudflare logs for any errors

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and deployed

## Bug Fix: AI Summary Not in Task Creation Emails (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem
Task creation emails were being sent immediately without the AI summary, even though AI summaries were being generated and shown on task cards in the UI.

**User Experience:**
- UI showed AI summary on task card ‚úÖ
- Task completion email showed AI summary ‚úÖ
- **Task creation email had NO AI summary** ‚ùå

### Root Cause
**Race condition!** The email was sent before the AI summary was generated.

**Buggy flow:**
```
1. Task created in database
2. AI summary generation triggered (async, "fire and forget")
3. Email sent immediately ‚Üê Email goes out without AI summary!
4. AI summary finishes later (but email already sent)
```

**Code showing the problem:**
```typescript
// In tasks.ts
const task = await DB.prepare('INSERT INTO tasks...').run();

// AI generation (async, doesn't wait)
c.executionCtx.waitUntil(
  fetch('/api/ai/generate-summary', {...})  // Fire and forget
);

// Email sent immediately (no AI summary yet!)
await EMAIL_QUEUE.send({
  type: 'task_created',
  task: {
    name: taskName,
    description,
    estimatedTime
    // ‚ùå No aiSummary!
  }
});
```

### Solution
**Move email sending to AFTER AI summary generation.**

**Fixed flow:**
```
1. Task created in database
2. AI summary generation triggered (async)
3. AI summary generated by OpenAI
4. AI summary saved to database
5. Email sent WITH AI summary ‚Üê Email now includes AI!
```

**Fixed code:**

**tasks.ts (removed immediate email):**
```typescript
const task = await DB.prepare('INSERT INTO tasks...').run();

// AI generation WITH email notification
c.executionCtx.waitUntil(
  fetch('/api/ai/generate-summary', {
    body: JSON.stringify({
      taskId,
      taskName,
      description,
      estimatedTime,
      sendEmail: true  // Tell AI worker to send email
    })
  })
);

// ‚úÖ No immediate email, it will be sent after AI is done
```

**ai.ts (added email after summary):**
```typescript
// Generate AI summary
const summary = await openai.chat.completions.create({...});

// Save summary to database
await DB.prepare('UPDATE tasks SET ai_summary = ?').bind(summary).run();

// Send email WITH AI summary
if (sendEmail) {
  await EMAIL_QUEUE.send({
    type: 'task_created',
    task: {
      name: taskName,
      description,
      estimatedTime,
      aiSummary: summary  // ‚úÖ AI summary included!
    }
  });
}
```

**email-consumer.ts (added AI summary to template):**
```typescript
// In buildTaskCreatedEmail()
<div class="task-name">${task.name}</div>

${task.aiSummary ? `
<div class="ai-summary-box">
  <strong>ü§ñ AI INSIGHT</strong>
  <p>${task.aiSummary}</p>
</div>
` : ''}
```

### How to Avoid This
1. ‚úÖ **Understand async operations** - "fire and forget" means you don't wait for results
2. ‚úÖ **Chain dependent operations** - If B depends on A, trigger B after A completes
3. ‚úÖ **Test the entire flow** - Create task ‚Üí Check email ‚Üí Verify AI summary is there
4. ‚úÖ **Add timing logs** - Log when each step happens to debug race conditions
5. ‚úÖ **Consider user experience** - Is it better to send email quickly without AI, or wait 2-3 seconds for AI?

### Trade-offs

**Option 1: Send email immediately (old way)**
- ‚úÖ Fast response
- ‚ùå No AI summary in email
- ‚ùå Incomplete information

**Option 2: Send email after AI (new way)**
- ‚úÖ Complete information with AI insight
- ‚úÖ Better user experience
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Email arrives 2-3 seconds later (acceptable)

**Decision:** Option 2 is better because AI insights are valuable and users expect them.

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create a new task
- [ ] Wait for AI summary to appear on task card (2-3 seconds)
- [ ] Check email inbox
- [ ] Verify email contains:
  - ‚úÖ Task name
  - ‚úÖ Description
  - ‚úÖ Estimated time
  - ‚úÖ **AI summary** with ü§ñ icon
  - ‚úÖ Beautiful blue box design
- [ ] Complete the task
- [ ] Verify completion email also has AI summary

### Performance Impact
**Before:** Email sent in ~100ms (but incomplete)  
**After:** Email sent in ~2-3 seconds (but complete with AI)  

**User doesn't notice because:**
- Email is async anyway (they check it later)
- 2-3 seconds is acceptable for email delivery
- The value of AI insights outweighs the delay

## Bug Fix: Asana Tasks Not Being Assigned (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem
Asana integration was creating tasks successfully and completing them, but tasks were **not being assigned** to the correct user in Asana.

**Symptoms:**
- ‚úÖ Tasks created in Asana
- ‚úÖ Tasks completed in Asana
- ‚ùå Tasks not assigned to anyone

### Root Cause
**Invalid email format in database!** The `default_assignee_email` in the `integrations` table config was missing the `@` symbol.

**Bad data in D1:**
```json
{
  "project_gid": "1206615013870411",
  "default_assignee_email": "benjiechannelautomation.com",  // ‚ùå Missing @
  "workspace_gid": "1204857085390737"
}
```

**Should be:**
```json
{
  "project_gid": "1206615013870411",
  "default_assignee_email": "benjie@channelautomation.com",  // ‚úÖ Valid email
  "workspace_gid": "1204857085390737"
}
```

**Why this breaks assignment:**

The code in `tasks.ts` (lines 82-123) correctly:
1. Fetches all users from Asana workspace
2. Looks for a user whose email matches `default_assignee_email` (case-insensitive)
3. If found, sets `asanaPayload.data.assignee = user.gid`

However, when searching with `benjiechannelautomation.com`, no match is found because:
- Asana user emails are properly formatted: `user@domain.com`
- The search looks for exact match: `u.email?.toLowerCase() === assigneeEmail.toLowerCase()`
- `user@domain.com` !== `userdomain.com`

### Solution

**Step 1: Find your correct email in Asana**

First, check what email is associated with your Asana account:
```bash
# Using wrangler to query Asana
wrangler secret put ASANA_TOKEN --env development
# Then manually check Asana settings or use this query
```

Or check manually at: https://app.asana.com/0/my-settings ‚Üí Profile

**Step 2: Update the D1 database**

```sql
-- Update the config JSON with correct email
UPDATE integrations
SET config = json_set(
  config,
  '$.default_assignee_email',
  'YOUR_CORRECT_EMAIL@domain.com'  -- Replace with your actual email
)
WHERE integration_type = 'asana'
AND user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

**Step 3: Run via wrangler**

```bash
wrangler d1 execute task-manager-dev --remote --command "
UPDATE integrations
SET config = json_set(config, '$.default_assignee_email', 'benjie@channelautomation.com')
WHERE integration_type = 'asana';
"
```

**Step 4: Verify the fix**

```sql
SELECT id, user_id, integration_type, config
FROM integrations
WHERE integration_type = 'asana';
```

### How to Avoid This

1. ‚úÖ **Add email validation in frontend** - When user enters Asana config, validate email format
2. ‚úÖ **Validate on backend** - Check email format before saving to database
3. ‚úÖ **Test assignee lookup** - When saving integration, immediately test if user can be found
4. ‚úÖ **Better error messages** - Log when assignee lookup fails with available emails
5. ‚úÖ **Auto-detect email** - Use Asana API to get current user's email automatically

### Code Improvements

**Add validation in integrations worker:**

```typescript
// In integrations.ts
function isValidEmail(email: string): boolean {
  const emailRegex = /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/;
  return emailRegex.test(email);
}

// Before saving config
if (config.default_assignee_email && !isValidEmail(config.default_assignee_email)) {
  return c.json({ error: 'Invalid email format for assignee' }, 400);
}
```

**Better logging in tasks.ts (already present but worth highlighting):**

```typescript
// Line 111-112 shows available emails when lookup fails
console.log(`‚úó User with email ${assigneeEmail} not found. Available emails:`,
  usersData.data?.filter((u: any) => u.email).map((u: any) => u.email).join(', '));
```

This helps debug email mismatches!

### Testing Checklist

After fixing the email:
- [ ] Create a new task in the app
- [ ] Check Asana project - task should appear
- [ ] Verify task is assigned to the correct user
- [ ] Check Cloudflare logs for "‚úì Assigned task to user: ..."
- [ ] Complete the task in app
- [ ] Verify task is marked complete in Asana

### Key Takeaway

**When implementing third-party integrations:**
1. **Validate all input data** - Email, URLs, IDs, etc.
2. **Test integration immediately** - Don't wait until user reports issue
3. **Add helpful logging** - Show what the system is looking for vs what it found
4. **Fail gracefully** - If assignee not found, still create task (already doing this!)
5. **Guide users** - Consider fetching user email from Asana automatically

**The code was correct, the data was wrong!** This highlights the importance of input validation.

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Changed to use `/users/me` API instead of email lookup  
**Date:** October 12, 2025

### Update: The Real Root Cause

After checking the actual database, the email was correctly stored with `@` symbol. The real issue was different:

**The Asana workspace users API doesn't expose email addresses!**

When querying `GET /workspaces/{gid}/users?opt_fields=email,name,gid`:
- ‚úÖ Returns 343 users
- ‚ùå Email field is empty for all users (privacy/permissions)
- Result: Cannot match users by email

**Better Solution Implemented:**

Instead of looking up users by email, use the authenticated user directly:

```typescript
// OLD APPROACH (doesn't work)
const usersResponse = await fetch(
  `https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/workspaces/${workspaceGid}/users?opt_fields=email,name,gid`
);
const user = usersData.data?.find(u => u.email === assigneeEmail); // Always fails!

// NEW APPROACH (works!)
const meResponse = await fetch('https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/users/me', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${api_key}` }
});
asanaPayload.data.assignee = userData.data.gid; // Always assigns to token owner
```

**Benefits:**
1. ‚úÖ No email lookup needed
2. ‚úÖ Always assigns to the API token owner (usually correct)
3. ‚úÖ More reliable - no privacy/permission issues
4. ‚úÖ Simpler code - one API call instead of searching through hundreds of users

**Files Changed:**
- `cloudflare-workers/src/workers/tasks.ts` - Lines 82-115

**Deployment:**
```bash
wrangler deploy --env development
# Version: 80530646-8fe4-48be-b9fe-d8dd185a9a81
```

## Feature: Task Card Focus View (Oct 13, 2025)

### Problem
Task cards were always fully expanded showing all details (timer, description, AI summary, metadata, buttons). When users have multiple tasks:
- Takes too much vertical space
- Hard to see all tasks at once
- Difficult to quickly scan active tasks

### Solution
Implemented collapsible/expandable task cards with two view modes:

**Compact View (Default):**
- Task name
- Running timer (small format)
- Status badge
- Expand button (maximize icon)

**Focus View (Expanded):**
- Large timer display
- Full description
- AI summary
- Metadata (estimated time, created date, task link)
- Action buttons (Complete, Delete)

### Implementation

**Added state to track expanded task:**
```typescript
const [expandedTaskId, setExpandedTaskId] = useState<string | null>(null);

const toggleExpand = (taskId: string) => {
  setExpandedTaskId(expandedTaskId === taskId ? null : taskId);
};
```

**Conditional rendering:**
```typescript
{tasks.map((task) => {
  const isExpanded = expandedTaskId === task.id;
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Always show: Compact header */}
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between">
        <h3>{task.task_name}</h3>
        {!isExpanded && <span>{calculateElapsedTime(task.started_at)}</span>}
        <button onClick={() => toggleExpand(task.id)}>
          {isExpanded ? <Minimize2 /> : <Maximize2 />}
        </button>
      </div>
      
      {/* Show only when expanded: Full details */}
      {isExpanded && (
        <>
          <Timer />
          <Description />
          <AISummary />
          <Metadata />
          <ActionButtons />
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
})}
```

### Benefits

1. ‚úÖ **Better space management** - Compact view takes 1/4 the space
2. ‚úÖ **Quick scanning** - Users can see all active tasks at once
3. ‚úÖ **Focus mode** - Expand one task to see full details
4. ‚úÖ **Smooth transitions** - Clean expand/collapse animations
5. ‚úÖ **Keyboard accessible** - Button has proper title attribute

### User Experience

**Before:** All tasks always fully expanded
- 3 tasks = 3 full screen scrolls
- Hard to compare tasks
- Information overload

**After:** Tasks collapsed by default
- 3 tasks = 1 screen
- Easy to see all tasks
- Expand only when needed

### Files Changed
- `src/components/TaskList.tsx` - Added expand/collapse functionality
- Added `Maximize2` and `Minimize2` icons from lucide-react

### Testing Checklist
- [x] Task cards show compact view by default
- [x] Click expand button shows full details
- [x] Click collapse button returns to compact view
- [x] Timer updates in both views
- [x] Only one task can be expanded at a time
- [x] Action buttons only visible in expanded view
- [x] No linting errors

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and tested  
**Date:** October 13, 2025

## Feature: Standalone Task Focus Route (Oct 13, 2025)

### Problem
Users could only view tasks within the main task list. There was no way to:
- Share a direct link to a specific task
- Open a task in its own dedicated view
- Focus on a single task without distractions
- Bookmark or reference a specific task

### Solution
Implemented React Router with a standalone route for individual task viewing at `/task/:taskId`.

**New Routes:**
- `/` - Main dashboard with all tasks
- `/task/:taskId` - Dedicated focus view for a single task
- `*` - Catch-all redirects to home

### Implementation

**1. Installed React Router:**
```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

**2. Created TaskDetailView Component:**
```typescript
// src/components/TaskDetailView.tsx
export function TaskDetailView() {
  const { taskId } = useParams<{ taskId: string }>();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  
  // Fetch specific task
  // Display in full-screen focus view
  // Navigate back with Back button
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses `useParams()` to get taskId from URL
- Uses `useNavigate()` for programmatic navigation
- Full-screen layout with back button
- Larger timer display (text-7xl vs text-6xl)
- Larger action buttons
- Auto-focuses completion note textarea
- Handles task not found / already completed

**3. Updated App.tsx with Router:**
```typescript
function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <AuthProvider>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<TaskManager />} />
          <Route path="/task/:taskId" element={<TaskDetailView />} />
          <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />
        </Routes>
      </AuthProvider>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

**4. Added Focus View Button to TaskList:**
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => navigate(`/task/${task.id}`)}
  className="bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white p-2 rounded-lg"
  title="Open in Focus View"
>
  <ExternalLink className="w-5 h-5" />
</button>
```

### User Experience

**Before:**
- Tasks only viewable in list
- No way to share task links
- Limited focus on individual tasks

**After:**
- Click purple "Focus View" button (external link icon)
- Opens task in dedicated full-screen view
- URL: `https://workoto.app/task/abc-123-def`
- Can share URL with team members
- Back button returns to dashboard
- Cleaner, distraction-free interface

### Features

1. ‚úÖ **Direct linking** - Share task URLs
2. ‚úÖ **Deep linking** - Open specific task from anywhere
3. ‚úÖ **Focus mode** - Full-screen, distraction-free
4. ‚úÖ **Navigation** - Back button to return to dashboard
5. ‚úÖ **Error handling** - Shows message if task not found
6. ‚úÖ **Real-time timer** - Updates every second in focus view
7. ‚úÖ **All actions available** - Complete, delete, add notes

### UI Improvements in Focus View

**Compared to inline view:**
- Larger timer: `text-7xl` (was `text-6xl`)
- More padding: `p-12` timer (was `p-8`)
- Larger buttons: `py-4` (was `py-3`)
- Bigger icons: `w-6 h-6` (was `w-5 h-5`)
- Section headers: Clear "Description", "Task Details"
- Full-width layout: `max-w-4xl` container
- Clean header with branding and back button

### Technical Details

**Dependencies Added:**
```json
{
  "react-router-dom": "^6.x.x"
}
```

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/TaskDetailView.tsx` - 350+ lines

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Added BrowserRouter and Routes
- `src/components/TaskList.tsx` - Added focus view button

**Build Impact:**
- Before: 278.91 kB
- After: 321.63 kB (+42.72 kB, +15.3% due to react-router-dom)
- Gzip: 83.26 kB (acceptable for SPA routing)

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Click focus view button opens task in new route
- [x] URL shows `/task/:taskId` correctly
- [x] Back button navigates to dashboard
- [x] Timer updates every second in focus view
- [x] Complete task redirects to dashboard
- [x] Delete task redirects to dashboard
- [x] Task not found shows error message
- [x] Direct URL navigation works
- [x] Browser back/forward buttons work
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Build succeeds

### Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. Add task editing in focus view
2. Share button with copy-to-clipboard
3. QR code generation for task URL
4. Print view for task
5. Add keyboard shortcuts (Esc to go back)
6. Add task navigation (prev/next task)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and deployed  
**Date:** October 13, 2025

## Feature: AI Summary Queue System & Email Subject Customization (Oct 12, 2025)

### Problem: Worker-to-Worker HTTP Calls Timing Out
**Issue:** When creating tasks, the system made HTTP calls from the tasks worker to the AI worker, resulting in 522 timeout errors. This prevented AI summaries from being generated and emails from being sent.

### Root Cause
Cloudflare Workers have strict timeout limits for HTTP requests. Making internal worker-to-worker HTTP calls caused:
- 522 Connection Timeout errors
- No AI summary generation
- No email notifications

### Solution: Cloudflare Queues Architecture
Implemented a **queue-based system** similar to the Supabase Edge Functions implementation:

**New Flow:**
1. Create task ‚Üí Save to database ‚úÖ
2. Queue AI summary job ‚Üí Return immediately ‚úÖ
3. Background AI consumer ‚Üí Generate summary ‚Üí Update task ‚Üí Send email with AI summary ‚úÖ

**Files Modified:**
1. **`wrangler.toml`** - Added AI queue configuration
2. **`types/index.ts`** - Added `AI_QUEUE` binding and `AIMessage` type
3. **`workers/ai-consumer.ts`** (NEW) - Background AI summary processor
4. **`index.ts`** - Routes queue messages to correct consumers
5. **`workers/tasks.ts`** - Changed from HTTP call to queue-based

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No timeouts - immediate response to user
- ‚úÖ Reliable AI summary generation in background
- ‚úÖ Email includes AI summary
- ‚úÖ Scalable architecture

### Feature: Email Subject Line Customization

**What Was Added:**
- Database columns: `email_subject_task_created` and `email_subject_task_completed`
- Settings UI to customize email subjects
- Placeholder support: `{task_name}` gets replaced with actual task name
- Email consumer already supported this feature (lines 48-64)

**Example:**
```
Custom Subject: "New Task Created: {task_name}"
Actual Email: "New Task Created: Create Voice AI Demo"
```

### Feature: Onboarding Email Input

**Problem:** Users couldn't specify which email address to receive notifications at during onboarding.

**Solution:** Added email input field to onboarding flow:
- ‚úÖ Email validation (required, valid format)
- ‚úÖ Saves to `settings.default_email`
- ‚úÖ Used for all task notifications
- ‚úÖ Clear error messaging

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/onboarding/NotificationPreferences.tsx`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  // Validate email
  if (!email.trim()) {
    setEmailError('Email address is required');
    return;
  }
  
  if (!validateEmail(email)) {
    setEmailError('Please enter a valid email address');
    return;
  }

  // Save notification preferences
  await apiClient.saveNotificationPreferences(preferences);
  
  // Save default email to settings
  await apiClient.updateSettings({ default_email: email });
  
  onComplete();
};
```

### Lessons Learned
1. **Avoid HTTP calls between workers** - Use Cloudflare Queues for async operations
2. **Queue-based architecture** is more reliable for time-consuming tasks like AI generation
3. **Email consumer design** was already flexible enough to support custom subjects
4. **Onboarding UX** should capture critical user preferences upfront (like notification email)
5. **Validation** is crucial - validate email format before saving

### How NOT to Do It
‚ùå Don't make HTTP calls between Cloudflare Workers for long operations
‚ùå Don't skip email validation in onboarding
‚ùå Don't assume the user's account email is where they want notifications

### How to Do It Right
‚úÖ Use Cloudflare Queues for background jobs
‚úÖ Implement proper email validation with clear error messages
‚úÖ Ask users for their notification email during onboarding
‚úÖ Design email templates with placeholder support for customization
‚úÖ Log all queue processing steps for debugging

## Bug Fix: Hardcoded User Name in Email Notifications (Oct 13, 2025)

### Problem
**Critical multi-tenant bug!** When users signed up and created tasks, they received email notifications with the developer's name "Benjie Malinao" instead of their own name.

**User Impact:**
- ‚ùå New user creates task ‚Üí Email says "Benjie Malinao just added a new task"
- ‚ùå User completes task ‚Üí Email says "Benjie Malinao just finished a task"
- ‚ùå Looks unprofessional and breaks user trust
- ‚ùå Privacy concern - wrong user identity in emails

### Root Cause
**Hardcoded developer name in email templates!** The email consumer was not fetching the actual user's name from the database.

**Buggy code (email-consumer.ts):**
```typescript
// Line 408 - Task Created Email
<h1>New Task Created!</h1>
<p>Benjie Malinao just added a new task</p>  // ‚ùå HARDCODED!

// Line 659 - Task Completed Email  
<h1>Task Completed!</h1>
<p>Benjie Malinao just finished a task</p>  // ‚ùå HARDCODED!
```

**Why this happened:**
1. Email templates were copied from single-user prototype
2. Never updated when app became multi-tenant
3. No user context was passed to email building functions
4. Wasn't caught in testing because developer only tested with own account

### Solution

**Step 1: Fetch user's name from database**
```typescript
// In email-consumer.ts queue handler
const user = await env.DB.prepare(`
  SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = ?
`).bind(userId).first<{ name: string | null }>();

const userName = user?.name || 'User';  // Fallback if name not set
```

**Step 2: Pass userName to all email building functions**
```typescript
// Updated function signatures
function buildTaskCreatedEmail(task: any, userName: string): string
function buildTaskCompletedEmail(task: any, userName: string): string  
function buildClockInEmail(userName: string): string
function buildDailyReportEmail(session: any, tasks: any[], userName: string): string

// Updated function calls
emailHtml = buildTaskCreatedEmail(task!, userName);
emailHtml = buildTaskCompletedEmail(task!, userName);
emailHtml = buildClockInEmail(userName);
emailHtml = buildDailyReportEmail(session!, tasks || [], userName);
```

**Step 3: Use dynamic userName in templates**
```typescript
// Task Created Email (Line 415)
<h1>New Task Created!</h1>
<p>${userName} just added a new task</p>  // ‚úÖ DYNAMIC!

// Task Completed Email (Line 666)
<h1>Task Completed!</h1>
<p>${userName} just finished a task</p>  // ‚úÖ DYNAMIC!

// Clock In Email (Line 781)
<h1>‚è∞ Clocked In</h1>
<p>${userName} just started a work session</p>  // ‚úÖ DYNAMIC!

// Daily Report Email (Line 936)
<h1>üìä Daily Work Report</h1>
<p>${userName}'s work summary for ${date}</p>  // ‚úÖ DYNAMIC!
```

### How to Avoid This

1. ‚úÖ **Never hardcode user-specific data** - Always fetch from database
2. ‚úÖ **Test with multiple user accounts** - Create test users, don't just test with your own account
3. ‚úÖ **Review email templates carefully** - Search for any hardcoded names, emails, or personal data
4. ‚úÖ **Use template variables** - Design templates to accept dynamic data from the start
5. ‚úÖ **Grep for your name** - Before deploying, search codebase for your personal info
6. ‚úÖ **Multi-tenant mindset** - Always think "What if another user does this?"

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a new user account with different name
- [ ] Create a task
- [ ] Check email - should show NEW user's name, not "Benjie Malinao"
- [ ] Complete the task  
- [ ] Check email - should show NEW user's name
- [ ] Clock in
- [ ] Check email - should show NEW user's name
- [ ] Clock out
- [ ] Check daily report email - should show NEW user's name
- [ ] Grep for "Benjie Malinao" - should only be in docs/inactive code

### Files Modified

1. `cloudflare-workers/src/workers/email-consumer.ts`:
   - Added user name fetch from database (lines 14-18)
   - Updated all email function signatures to accept userName
   - Updated all email templates to use ${userName} instead of hardcoded name
   - Lines changed: 14-18, 62, 72, 77, 83, 246, 415, 481, 666, 744, 781, 797, 936

### Verification Command

```bash
# Ensure no hardcoded names in active code
grep -r "Benjie Malinao" cloudflare-workers/src/
# Should return nothing (or only comments)
```

### Key Takeaway

**When building multi-tenant SaaS apps:**
1. Every user-facing message must be personalized with their data
2. Test with multiple distinct user accounts, not just your own
3. Never copy-paste single-user code without removing hardcoded values
4. Add user context to ALL notification/email functions
5. Use grep to find your personal info before deploying

**This is a trust-breaking bug!** Users expect personalized emails with THEIR name, not the developer's.
